Things to Fix

After the user logs in/signs up through the sign up or login page, it should only wait a total of one second and then open the dashboard of the logged in account page instead of just staying at the sign up/log in page.
On the Side bar make the sidebar slightly bigger so that the notification button and the “x”/close sidebar button don't look jammed with the app title. Format as needed to make it look nice and professional. 
On the dashboard, add space between top bar/tab(where it says good morning/evening/afternoon and the date) and the boxes that say total classes, pending tasks, and the other two and over there, add place where real quotes are displayed. Real quotes from people like thomas edison, albert einstein, michael jordan, roger federer, ruth babe, and many many many more real people should be added there and there should also be a place on it where user can click and switch between the many real quotes from real people. 
On the dashboard, when clicked on the box that says total classes, it should open the classes tab. When clicked on Pending Tasks, it should open the tasks tab. Also the Study Streak box should actually be called “Next Event” and have
On the Home Page, on the dashboard, make sure the notification button actually works and displays notifications if there are any in a good sized pop up. 
When there is nothing scheduled, notifications should display an empty notification pop up and state that there aren't any notifications in a professional way. Notifications should contain overdue assignments reminders
When adding assignments, after putting details inside the pop-up and pressing “add assignment” an error pops up saying error failed to add assignment. Fix this to allow the user to add assignments. Also, it should provide option for deadline and deadline should display on the deadlines box in the calendars tab. These boxes should be updated as user adds/changes/edits information. 
Make sure the “All”, “Pending”, “In Progress”, “Completed”, and “Overdue” actually work and are based on the date given by the user. “All” should display every assignment even if it is complete, overdue, in progress, or pending. In all, make sure it organizes itself in a way that overdue assignments are on top, then all pending assignments below, then in progress assignments, then completed assignments. Allow the user to drag and reposition the assignments. Also have a well placed button that says sort by that allows user to pick between default (that takes it back to the default positioning of the tasks where its overdue, pending, in progress, then completed), and another option called By Priority where it organizes the tasks in high priority to low priority, and another option called By Most Time where it organizes it by which takes most time to least time, and another option called By Least Time where it organizes it by which takes least time to most time. 
Calendar things like repeat
Allow the user to pick what color they want to pick for the event and allow user to pick if it repeats.(like repeats daily, or what days of each week, or monthly, yearly, etc). This should show on calendar; if picked daily, event should show each day, if picked yearly it should show each year on that day, etc.). Show two events for each day maximum and a see more button for the rest events scheduled that day. 
On the sidebar, when clicked on the yellow badge button, make sure when entered “unlock12345” and only “unlock12345” NOTHING ELSE, it displays a pop up stating, “You have entered staff mode. AI mode and other premium features have still not been released” and nothing should change. User can click an x to leave that pop up and everything will be same except that the yellow badge will change to a red x until clicked on and then a pop saying you have left staff mode and back to yellow badge. 
Allow user to add school name in customize profile tab and display school name instead of “Student” under the user name in sidebar. 
When clicked on view all in the recent activity box in the dashboard, provide a pop up showing all recent activity that can be scrolled through.
